description: 'Install LoriTime on Paper, Folia, or Velocity.'
---

This page walks you through installing LoriTime on a Paper/Folia server or a Velocity proxy network.

## Requirements

- Check the [Compatibility](../reference/compatibility.md) page before installing.
- Download the matching jar from the [latest release](https://github.com/RolePlay-Cauldron/LoriTime/releases/latest).

## Which Jar to Install

| Platform | Jar |
|----------|-----|
| Paper or Folia | `loritimepaper` |
| Velocity | `loritimevelocity` |

Install the Paper/Folia jar on every backend server that should run LoriTime. Install the Velocity jar on the proxy only when LoriTime should run on the proxy.

## Recommended Setups

| Setup | Use when | `multiSetup.mode` |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Single Paper/Folia server | One server owns its own storage. | `standalone` |
| Paper/Folia without a proxy | Each server is independent. | `standalone` |
| Standalone Velocity proxy | The proxy tracks playtime by backend server without Paper/Folia backend coordination. | `standalone` |
| Velocity proxy with Paper/Folia backends | The proxy owns canonical storage and backends report local context. | Proxy: `master`; backends: `slave` |

LoriTime does not support multi-proxy setups.

## First-Start Checklist

1. Put the matching LoriTime jar in the server or proxy `plugins` directory.
2. Start and stop the server or proxy once so LoriTime can create its files.
3. Edit `config.yml`, `commands.yml`, and language files as needed.
4. Start the server or proxy again.
5. Check the startup logs for storage, migration, and update messages.

## Storage Migration Note

LoriTime 2 no longer uses `yml` as a regular storage mode. If the migrated configuration selects `storageMethod: sqlite`, LoriTime imports legacy `data/names.yml` or `data/time.yml` files into SQLite and renames the old files with a `.migrated` suffix after a successful import. If `storageMethod` is `mysql` or `mariadb`, LoriTime migrates the configured SQL database and backs up local legacy flat files without importing them.

Back up your LoriTime data folder and SQL database before updating an existing production setup.

## When to Use Multi-Setup

Use multi-setup when a Velocity proxy should own canonical storage for the whole network while Paper/Folia backend servers report player world context, PlaceholderAPI cache data, or AFK state to the proxy.

You usually do not need multi-setup when:

- You run a single Paper/Folia server without a proxy.
- You run only LoriTime on Velocity and do not need Paper/Folia backend reporting.
- Each backend server should keep independent LoriTime data.
- You do not need proxy-owned storage or cross-backend time.

A standalone Velocity proxy can use `multiSetup.mode: standalone`. In that mode LoriTime can track time by Velocity backend server, but it cannot track Bukkit worlds and it does not provide PlaceholderAPI placeholders.

Use multi-setup when:

- You want one shared playtime store across a Velocity network.
- You want PlaceholderAPI values on Paper/Folia backends while the proxy owns storage.
- You want AFK detection on Paper/Folia backends with proxy-owned AFK effects.

## Single Server Setup

1. Install the `loritimepaper` jar in the Paper/Folia `plugins` directory.
2. Start and stop the server once.
3. Keep `multiSetup.mode` set to `standalone`.
4. Configure storage, commands, localization, AFK, and integrations as needed.
5. Start the server again.

```yml
multiSetup:
  mode: 'standalone'
```

## Multi-Setup Network Setup

1. Install the `loritimevelocity` jar in the Velocity proxy `plugins` directory.
2. Install the `loritimepaper` jar in every Paper/Folia backend `plugins` directory.
3. Start and stop the proxy and backend servers once.
4. Set the Velocity proxy `multiSetup.mode` to `master`.
5. Set every Paper/Folia backend `multiSetup.mode` to `slave`.
6. Start the proxy and backend servers again.

The proxy backend server name is used for canonical session rows. A Paper/Folia slave `server.name` is not used for canonical server entries in this setup.
